## Description

This is an implementation of the SAM2024 system for paper submission, review and management.

Currently, only the backend, however a frontend is fully designed and modeled out and can
be easily added on. 

The majority of features covered in the project description are covered. Certain things are
missing or only partially implemented such as, notifications, templates, and file storage. In 
addition to this it is mainly "happy day" paths that are covered.

As there is no frontend, we have writeen a suite of test to show that our backend is
working as intended.
